strappy-facets
==============

A convenient library of reusable user interface elements, extending Strappy's
"Facet" object. Contents of "hbs", "js", and "index.html" are mostly redundant
with those of the Strappy project, but included here for demonstration
purposes. The contents of "facets/" are what you're probably looking for; most
can be copied-and-pasted (the .JS and .HBS file for each one) as needed.
